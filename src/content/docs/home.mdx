# Welcome to Sona UI Documentation

## Overview

Sona UI is a modern, lightweight, and customizable UI component library designed to help developers build beautiful and responsive user interfaces with ease. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive set of components that are easy to use, well-documented, and highly performant.

## Our Goals

- Deliver high-quality, reusable UI components.
- Ensure accessibility and responsiveness across all devices.
- Provide clear and concise documentation for every component.
- Foster a community-driven approach to development.

## How to Use the Components

- A description of the component and its use cases.
- Code examples to help you integrate the component into your project.
- API details, including props and methods.
