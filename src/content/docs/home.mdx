# Welcome to Sona UI Documentation

## Overview

Sona UI is a modern, lightweight, and customizable UI component library designed to help developers build beautiful and responsive user interfaces with ease. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive set of components that are easy to use, well-documented, and highly performant.

## Our Goals

- Deliver high-quality, reusable UI components.
- Ensure accessibility and responsiveness across all devices.
- Provide clear and concise documentation for every component.
- Foster a community-driven approach to development.

## How to Use the Components

Each component in Sona UI comes with detailed documentation and examples. To get started, navigate to the component you want to use from the sidebar. You will find:

- A description of the component and its use cases.
- Code examples to help you integrate the component into your project.
- API details, including props and methods.
