{/* ## Customization

You can customize the BubbleUpButton in several ways:

1. **Animation Behavior**: Adjust the `motionControls` prop to change the speed and feel of the animation
2. **Styling**: Use the `className` prop to modify the button's appearance
3. **Content**: Add text, icons, or any other content as children
4. **Button Behavior**: All standard button props like `onClick`, `disabled`, etc. are supported

For best results, maintain the overflow and positioning properties as they're essential for the animation effect. */}
